\title{Predicts suitability for xy coordinates according to a trained MaxEnt model WITH cross-validation ('SDMmodelCV' object)}
\usage{
predict_xy_suitability_CV(
  xy.obj,
  xy.type,
  env.covar.obj,
  model.obj,
  mypath,
  predict.fun = "mean",
  predict.type = "cloglog",
  clamp.pred = TRUE,
  buffer.pred = FALSE,
  buffer.fun = c("min", "mean", "max"),
  buffer.dist = 20000,
  crs = "ESRI:54017",
  output.name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy.obj}{Should be a .csv file or data frame that contains xy coordinate
data only. Coordinates should be in decimal degree format. Longitude should be
listed first, followed by latitude. If a .csv file, file path should be in the
format produced by the \code{\link[=file.path]{file.path()}} function (i.e. with '/' instead of '\\').}

\item{xy.type}{Character. Description of the xy data. If species occurrence
data, list the name of the species. If another type of coordinate data, list that
name. If providing more than one data type or species, separate into different
data frames before adding to this function}

\item{env.covar.obj}{A stack of rasters of environmental covariates. These
covariates may be the same covariates used to train the model, or they may be
temporally or spatially projected (ex, for climate change). Suitability
predictions will be made based on these rasters. See details for additional
formatting information.}

\item{model.obj}{A model object created by the package \code{SDMtune}.}

\item{mypath}{Character.A file path to the sub directory where the model
output will be stored. Should be used with the \code{\link[=file.path]{file.path()}} function
(i.e. with '/' instead of '\\'). If this sub directory does not already exist
and should be created by the function, set \code{create.dir = TRUE}. This will
create a folder from the last part of the filepath in \code{mypath}.}

\item{predict.fun}{Character. This is the function to
be applied to combine the iterations of the model when predicting a suitability
output. Can be one of: \code{min}, \code{mean}, \code{median}, \code{max}, or \code{sd}
(standard deviation). If multiple are desired, must be in the concatenated
form: \code{c("mean", "max")}. Should be all lowercase.}

\item{predict.type}{Character. The type of raster output
to be created from the trained model. Can be one of \code{raw}, \code{logistic} or
\code{cloglog}. If multiple are desired, must be in the concatenated
form: \code{c("cloglog", "logistic")}}

\item{clamp.pred}{Logical. Should clamping be performed?}

\item{buffer.pred}{Logical. Should suitability predictions be made based
on a calculation from a buffer around the xy coordinate data? (For Example, take
the mean, max, etc value of a 20m buffer around the xy coordinates).}

\item{buffer.fun}{Character. The possible functions that can be used to calculate
the suitability value for the buffer around a point. Possible values include:
"min", "mean", "max", "sum", "isNA", and "notNA".}

\item{buffer.dist}{Numeric. The distance from each xy coordinate at which to
calculate the suitability value.}

\item{crs}{Character. The crs of the projection used in building the input species data.
Default is "ESRI:54017", the Behrmann Equal Area projection.}

\item{output.name}{The name of the file output. Separate words with _. Relevant
information might include the name of the model used to predict, the spatial
scale, the temporal scale, and the type of data points that are being used for
predictions.}
}
\value{
This function returns 3+ .csv files.
\itemize{
\item \code{xy_with_data}: contains the input xy coordinates with the value of each
given environmental covariate at that location.
\item \code{xy_no_data}: contains any coordinates that could not be predicted because
of an NA value for one or more covariates at that location.
\item \code{xy_pred_suit}: This is the main result file, which contains each coordinate,
the type of record and the predicted suitability value. One result file will
be returned per predict.type, predict.fun and buffer.fun combination.
}
}
\description{
This function predicts establishment suitability for SLF based on a trained
MaxEnt model for a set of xy coordinates. The default method is simple point-wise
predictions, but predictions can also be made using a buffer zone around each
xy coordinate by setting buffer.pred = TRUE.
}
\details{
The function requires the packages 'cli', 'terra', 'tidyverse', and 'SDMtune'.

The xy coordinates do not need to be within the training area for the model, but
clamping should be applied if they are not within the training are (clamp.pred = TRUE).
