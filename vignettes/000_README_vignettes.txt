This README is for the vignettes subfolder, which contains workflows for my package scari.
Outputs from these vignettes are stored in "data" or "vignette-outputs".
Old versions of these vignettes are stored in scari/scari_sandbox (scari in this case is not the package root folder, but is one folder above that in OneDrive).

----------110_ensemble_regional_models.Rmd----------

## About

This vignette takes steps to ensemble the predictions of each regional model into an ensemble. Ensembling is done per time period and ssp scenario. The three ssp scenarios are also ensembled into a final mean / modal prediction. First, rasters are weighted using the AUC and exdet per model and a weighted mean is taken. Next, rasters and MTSS / MTP thresholds are ensembled. MICs are also ensembled. Finally, we analyze the percent contribution of each model to the ensemble.

## Changelog

v0- initial version- in sandbox/vignettes_old
